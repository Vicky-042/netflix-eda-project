# 📺 Netflix EDA Project

Hi there! 👋 This is a data analysis project I worked on to explore what kind of content Netflix offers — from movies and shows to genres, release years, and durations. It's a beginner-friendly EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

---

### 🔍 What This Project Does

Using a dataset from Kaggle, I’ve answered questions like:

- Are there more movies or TV shows on Netflix?
- Which years had the most releases?
- What are the most popular genres?
- How long are the movies and shows, on average?

This helped me practice data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling with data!
